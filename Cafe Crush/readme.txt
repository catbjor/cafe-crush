Introducing Verdante - a brand new Verdana inspired typeface.

Verdana might not be the most aesthetic typeface, but its organic, humanist characteristics like its large x-height, open counters and loose spacing make it readable in small sizes on low resolution computer screens. 

It has survived through the decades and gained its place in the hall of fame of accesible typefaces. But it is also one people love to hate.

Verdante is a refresh of its predecessor - keeping all the good bits, but also addressing some of the less appealing elements.

Design considerations were based on research projects and publications by Royal Danish Academy â€“ Architecture, Design, Conservation.

To encourage good practice around accessibility, the typeface would be distributed free of charge with an accompanying digital handbook.

To further inform and engage with designers and typography enthusiasts, an Instagram profile would be created featuring valuable educational posts.
